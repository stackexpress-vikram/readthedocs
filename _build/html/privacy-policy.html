You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email account.
You also have the option to give us more information if you want to,

<p>“User Personal Information” is any information about one of our users which could,

Information such as a user name and password, an email address,
a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.”</p>

<h2>What information Read the Docs does not collect<a class="headerlink" href="#what-information-read-the-docs-does-not-collect" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>,
such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information.</p>
<p>Documentation Sites hosted on Read the Docs are public,
anyone (including us) may view their contents.
If you have included private or sensitive information in your Documentation Site,
such as email addresses, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>
<p>If you’re a <strong>child under the age of 13</strong>, you may not have an account on Read the Docs.
Read the Docs does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13.
If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account.
We don’t want to discourage you from writing software documentation, but those are the rules.</p>

<h2>How we share the information we collect<a class="headerlink" href="#how-we-share-the-information-we-collect" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with
third parties for their commercial purposes.</p>
<p>We do not disclose User Personal Information outside Read the Docs,
except in the situations listed in this section or
in the section below on compelled disclosure.</p>
<p>We <strong>do</strong> share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information
with others about how our users, collectively, use Read the Docs.
For example, we may compile statistics on the prevalence of
different types of documentation across Read the Docs for a blog post
or popularity of programming languages for advertising partners.</p>
<p>We <strong>do</strong> host advertising on Documentation Sites.
This advertising is first-party advertising hosted by Read the Docs.
We <strong>do not</strong> run any code from advertisers and all ad images are hosted
on Read the Docs’ servers. For more details, see our document on
<a class="reference internal" href="advertising/advertising-details.html"><span class="doc">Advertising Details</span></a>.</p>
<p>We may use User Personal Information with your permission,
so we can perform services you have requested.
For example, if you request service on commercially hosted docs,
we will ask your permission to sync your private repositories.</p>
<p>We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors
who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service,
and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement.
For more details, see our next section on
<a class="reference internal" href="#third-party-vendors"><span class="std std-ref">third parties</span></a>.</p>

is subject to their policies and practices.
This list will be updated from time to time
and we encourage you to check back periodically.</p>

<p>Read the Docs supports Do Not Track (DNT) and respects users’ tracking preferences.

<p>For Read the Docs, this means:</p>

<li>When DNT is enabled, both logged-in and logged-out users
are considered opted-out of <a class="reference internal" href="#google-analytics"><span class="std std-ref">analytics</span></a>.</li>
<li>Regardless of DNT preference, our logs that contain IP addresses

<li>Our full DNT policy is <a class="reference external" href="https://readthedocs.org/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt">available here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our DNT policy applies without reservation to readthedocs.org and readthedocs.com.

<h3>Google Analytics<a class="headerlink" href="#google-analytics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service,
but we don’t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information.
We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs
and how our users, in general, navigate through and use Read the Docs.
This helps us evaluate our users’ use of Read the Docs;
compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance.</p>
<p>Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time,
such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages,
time stamp, and similar data about your use of Read the Docs.
We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name.</p>
<p>Read the Docs will not, nor will we allow any third party to,
use the Google Analytics tool to track our users individually;
collect any User Personal Information other than IP address;
or correlate your IP address with your identity.
